    "\n",
    "## 1. What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is a pattern where an LLM **does not answer purely from its internal weights**.  \n",
    "Instead, it first **retrieves external information** (documents, snippets, records)  \n",
    "and then uses that context to generate an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Without RAG: *Model guesses from what it \"remembers\".*\n",
    "- With RAG: *Model reads from your data, then answers.*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of it as:\n",
    "> **“Search first, then generate.”**  \n",
    "\n",
    "This makes RAG:\n",
    "- More **up to date** (you can index new data),\n",
    "- More **controllable** (you decide which data it sees),\n",
    "- More **grounded** (answers can cite sources).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Why RAG vs Fine-Tuning?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fine-tuning** changes the model weights to adapt it to a task or data distribution.  \n",
    "**RAG** keeps the model *frozen* but feeds it relevant external knowledge at query time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RAG advantages:**\n",
    "- No need to retrain when data changes — just re-index.\n",
    "- Easier to control access (e.g., per-user documents).\n",
    "- Typically cheaper and safer for most knowledge-heavy apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fine-tuning advantages:**\n",
    "- Good for *skills* (formatting, style, domain tone) and niche tasks.\n",
    "- Can compress patterns into the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, real systems use: **RAG + small fine-tuning** (for style or tools).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Where RAG Lives in the LLM Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "Very roughly, the stack looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Raw data** (PDFs, DBs, APIs)  \n",
    "2. **Indexing** (chunking + embeddings + vector DB)  \n",
    "3. **Orchestration** (retriever, prompts, tools, policies)  \n",
    "4. **LLM inference** (generation)  \n",
    "5. **Evaluation & monitoring**\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is **not the model itself** — it is the **system around the model**:  \n",
    "- How we prepare and store data  \n",
    "- How we retrieve and inject it  \n",
    "- How we control and evaluate responses\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this prevents you from thinking “RAG = one function call”.  \n",
    "It is an **architecture pattern**, not a single tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Pre-RAG Landscape (TF-IDF, BM25, Classic IR)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before embeddings and RAG, search used mostly **lexical** methods:\n",
    "- TF-IDF: score based on how frequently words appear.\n",
    "- BM25: improved variant of TF-IDF, still word-based.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods work well for:\n",
    "- Exact word matches,\n",
    "- Short documents,\n",
    "- Keyword-style queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "They struggle with:\n",
    "- Synonyms (“doctor” vs “physician”),\n",
    "- Semantic meaning (“heart attack” vs “myocardial infarction”),\n",
    "- Long, fuzzy questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings + RAG **extend** this tradition with **semantic search**, not replace it entirely —  \n",
    "in modern systems, **hybrid** (BM25 + vectors) is common.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Minimal LLM Background for RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t need full transformer math, but you should know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tokens**: Models read tokens, not raw characters.\n",
    "- **Context window**: Hard limit to how much text you can pass at once.\n",
    "- **Prompt structure**: System message, user message, tool calls, etc.\n",
    "- **Hallucinations**: Model “inventing” plausible but false answers.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 7.1 Why Chunking is Harder Than “Every 500 Tokens”\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive chunking (e.g., every 500 characters) can split mid-sentence or mid-section.  \n",
    "This can:\n",
    "- Break context,\n",
    "- Make retrieval less useful,\n",
    "- Increase noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better strategies aim to preserve **semantic units**:\n",
    "- Paragraphs,\n",
    "- Sections,\n",
    "- Headings,\n",
    "- Code blocks (for code RAG),\n",
    "- Clauses in legal/medical text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.2 Common Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fixed-size + overlap**:  \n",
    "  - Example: 512 tokens with 128 overlap.  \n",
    "  - Simple, robust, easy to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recursive / structural chunking**:  \n",
    "  - Use headings (H1/H2/H3) and paragraph boundaries first.  \n",
    "  - Then further split long sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semantic chunking**:  \n",
    "  - Use models to group sentences that belong together conceptually.  \n",
    "  - More complex, but can improve retrieval quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key idea:\n",
    "> You want chunks that are **small enough** to be precise, but **large enough** to contain a meaningful answer.\n",

    "## 8. Embeddings — Turning Text into Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings are functions that map text → vector of numbers (e.g., 768 dimensions).  \n",
    "Similar texts have vectors that are **close** in this space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dense embeddings**: e.g., OpenAI, sentence transformers.  \n",
    "- **Sparse embeddings**: e.g., BM25 or newer sparse models, closer to keyword search.  \n",
    "- **Hybrid**: combine both to get best of lexical + semantic search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important design decisions:\n",
    "- Which embedding model (domain-specific models often help).  \n",
    "- How long the text per embedding (chunk size).  \n",
    "- Whether to use multi-vector embeddings (separate vectors per field).\n",

    "2. Perform **k-nearest neighbors** search (k-NN or ANN).  \n",
    "3. Return top-k chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key concepts:\n",
    "- **Index type** (HNSW, IVF, PQ) affects speed vs accuracy.\n",

    "\n",
    "Common patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Local/dev RAG**:  \n",
    "  - All on one machine, small vector store, simple stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cloud RAG**:  \n",
    "  - Managed vector DB (Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.),  \n",
    "  - LLM API (OpenAI, etc.),  \n",
    "  - Backend service orchestrating everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hybrid RAG**:  \n",
    "  - Some data/indexes on-prem (sensitive),  \n",
    "  - Some in cloud (public docs),  \n",
    "  - Orchestrator routes queries accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pattern balances:\n",
    "- Data residency / privacy,\n",
    "- Latency,\n",
    "- Cost,\n",
    "- Operational complexity.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 27. Knowledge Graph + RAG (GraphRAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key idea:\n",
    "- Use **structured relationships** between entities to improve retrieval and reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "- Can follow paths like: A → B → C in the graph,\n",
    "- Can detect clusters / communities,\n",
    "- Can prioritize central or authoritative entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphRAG often involves:\n",
    "- Extracting entities and relations from text,\n",
    "- Building a graph DB (e.g., Neo4j),\n",
    "- Combining graph traversal with vector retrieval,\n",
    "- Providing the LLM with both textual and structural context.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 28. Enterprise Concerns: Access Control, Governance, Compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "When RAG is used in a company:\n",
    "- Not all users should see all documents,\n",
    "- Some data may be private, secret, or regulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key requirements:\n",
    "- **Row-level / document-level access control**:  \n",
    "  - Filter results by user permissions before returning them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Audit logs**:  \n",
    "  - Who queried what, what data was used, what answer produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PII & compliance**:  \n",
    "  - Some content may need masking or special handling (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Designing enterprise RAG means thinking beyond “does it work?” to “is it safe, fair, compliant?”.  \n"
