    "## 1. Foundations: How to Think in Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we name specific patterns, it helps to lock in a few meta-principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Agents Are Loops, Not Single Calls\n",
    "\n",
    "Bad mental model:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “An agent is just an LLM with a long prompt.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Better mental model:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “An agent is a **loop** that:  \n",
    "> think → decide → act → observe → update → repeat (until done).”\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Agents **accumulate state** (memory, observations)\n",
    "- Actions are **discrete steps**, not just “one big answer”\n",
    "- Tools must be designed for **iteration**, not one-shot miracles\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Patterns Combine Roles, Tools, and Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Each pattern usually defines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Roles** (planner, executor, critic, worker, etc.)\n",
    "- **Tools** (retrieval, APIs, code execution, etc.)\n",
    "- **Loop structure** (when to think, when to act, when to stop)\n",
    "\n",
    "A good pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is **easy to explain**\n",
    "- Has **clear stopping conditions**\n",
    "- Has **obvious “failure shapes”** you can test and monitor\n"

    "## 2. ReAct Pattern (Reason + Act)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ReAct pattern is the **canonical base** for agentic workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **THOUGHT** – model reasons about the situation\n",
    "2. **ACTION** – picks a tool (or NONE)\n",
    "3. **ACTION_INPUT** – arguments for the tool\n",
    "4. **OBSERVATION** – tool result fed back to the next step\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat until:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **final answer** is ready, or  \n",
    "- The agent hits a **step limit** or safety trigger  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 When to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "- You need a **single agent** that:\n",
    "  - calls tools\n",
    "  - explores multiple steps\n",
    "  - uses intermediate observations\n",
    "\n",
    "Good for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple research agents  \n",
    "- Data lookup + synthesis  \n",
    "- Short multi-step workflows  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "- Infinite loops if no stop condition  \n",
    "- Overuse of tools if prompt doesn’t discourage unnecessary calls  \n",
    "- Harder to debug if logs are not structured  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make the step format **explicit** (THOUGHT / ACTION / ACTION_INPUT / OBSERVATION)\n",
    "- Log every step in a **structured way**\n",
    "- Set a **max_steps** (e.g., 5–10)\n",
    "- Clearly tell the model when to use `ACTION: NONE`\n"

    "\n",
    "Reflexion adds **self-critique** on top of ReAct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Basic Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Agent produces an initial answer (maybe using tools)  \n",
    "2. Agent (same or separate) evaluates the answer:\n",
    "   - “Is this correct? Did I miss anything?”  \n",
    "3. If needed, it:\n",
    "   - plans a correction  \n",
    "   - re-runs part of the process  \n",
    "   - updates the final answer  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 When to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "- High-stakes answers\n",
    "- Complex reasoning tasks\n",
    "- RAG scenarios where **coverage and correctness** matter\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Reflexion Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of self-eval prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- “Critique the above answer. List possible mistakes or missing details.”\n",
    "- “Given your critique, refine your answer.”\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Risks\n",
    "\n",
    "- Longer runtimes, more tokens  \n",
    "- Self-critique can still hallucinate  \n",
    "- Must have clear **retry limits**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.5 Pattern Variants\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single-agent reflexion: agent critiques itself  \n",
    "- Dual-agent reflexion: critic is a separate agent  \n",
    "- External judge: LLM-as-judge or custom eval pipeline\n"

    "1. Manager reads user request  \n",

    "3. Manager assigns tasks to workers  \n",
    "4. Workers produce outputs  \n",
    "5. Manager composes final answer  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 When to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multi-step tasks with distinct skills  \n",
